# Decision-Structures-
This is from Starting Out with Java by Tony Gaddis. Here I am answering the programming challenges. I'd like to say I am not a professional nor an educator so these answers are simply by how I think I should solve the problem. Coding isn't always about writing the code but understanding a problem, making a plan, proceeding to write the code, test, debug, etc. 
This chapter typically focuses on informing/teaching the user about decision structures in programming and ultizing the terms, methods, and strategies to tackle these strucutres in Java. The chapter does this through constructive end of section quizzes, end of chapter multiple choice, short answer, algorithm workbenches, programming challenges, and much more. 
Here I am typically only doing the coding puzzles. Note there is more than one day to do things such as this it's mostly about understanding the problem before you immediately rush to write code. Like cooking a meal, coding takes step and time to maste. Do not feel dishearted if it's too hard at first, it gets easier.
